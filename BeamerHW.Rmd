## Centaurea jacea and Centaurea nigra

> - Both native to Europe
> - Invasive in North America
> - Hybridize to form C. x Moncktonii

## Back-crossing

 {Centaurea jacea, Centaurea nigra, and Centaurea x moncktonii can all cross with each other, and this happens in invasive populations in North America.}

## Morphology

> - From the images of the different members of the family (if they were identified correctly), we can see that morphology is very similar.

\bigskip

> - \color{red} Morphology isn't a good way to identify!

## Questions

- When did North American populations hybridize? Before or after invasion? Both?
- How are populations in North America different than populations in Europe?
- Are there novel combinations of alleles in North America that don't exist in the native range?
